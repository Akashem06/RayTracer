The project is a learning tool to get familiar with Rust and ray tracing algorithms

Ray tracing in one weekend in C++ reference for getting started:
https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview

Similar project in Rust that helped me get started with the language:
https://github.com/dps/rust-raytracer

Future plan is to use GPU acceleration (via wgpu or cuda crates) and SIMD support from rust to accelerate image rendering with the ray tracer, and provide support for more objects
